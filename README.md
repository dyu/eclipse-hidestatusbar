Want more space in your Eclipse workspace?
==========================================

1. [Download](https://github.com/trustin/eclipse-hidestatusbar/downloads) this plugin and copy it into the `$ECLIPSE_HOME/dropins` directory to hide the toolbar and the status bar from your workspace.
2. Open the Preferences dialog, go to 'General -> Perspectives', and check 'Hide empty fast view bar'.
3. Use Mac OS X or Unity to save even more space by moving the menu bar into the top panel.
  * See [this workaround](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libdbusmenu/+bug/618587/comments/46) for Unity.
